## What is Git?

I’m learning a new language right now that includes *semantics* I’m only on the brink of understanding. The terminal is a portal into the unknown and I’m learning the language and how to appease the **‘Key Master’**.

Also learning about the connection between repositories on Github and cloning my work by downloading, no it’s not called downloading, *"pushed'* to my computer, and appeasing the Terminal Key Master with the right syntax.

Why does it need to be downloaded on my computer? Well, writing code is a collaborative endeavor and in order to work as a team, files need to be moved back and forth remotely through a process called **ACP (Add - Commit - Push**.

Versions of updates are logged in the file. Github is a VCS (Version Control System) and a centralized, distributed version control system.

This article was great in helping me clone the repositories I have on the Github site. Today I had some ‘A-Ha moments’ in understanding these new languages and it felt great!

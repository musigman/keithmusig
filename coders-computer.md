# Finding the editor that works for you
There are many text editors available for use. A text editor allows you to edit text and code and both windows and mac operating systems come with basic editors. Mac uses text edit and Windows uses notepad. 

The number of options can be confusing as which one you should use. *One piece of advice would be to use one that feels right, the best one is truly one you most enjoy using.*

More advanced editors have features that make writing code a whole lot easier such as **syntax highlighting** and **code completion**, which allows your text easier to read and saves time by writing the code for you.

There are so many free editors that the only cost involved is your time. You can also pay for subscription services. It is best to do your research and find the one that best suits you.

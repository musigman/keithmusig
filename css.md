# Designing Web Pages with CSS
While HTML creates the structure of a web page, CSS gives designers unlimited color, font and layout options. 

A .css file is a separate styling sheet that is linked from HTML code so the styles are recognized. While .css styles can be included in an HTML file using style tags, having a separate style sheet gives other pages of the web site consistent styling. 

## Color Usage Options
- Background
- foreground
- text
- outlines
- solid and opaque colorsCSS 3 is the most current version and handles a variety of color formats including: RGB, RGBA, Hex Code and HSLA. The latter 2 options on this list are my favorite because it gives the designer opacity options.

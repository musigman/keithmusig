# Basic Programming Concepts

What I got out of this reading was some basic concepts of writing Javascript, the language
and how it's applied. Javascript allows you to make web pages more interactive by modifying
content used in a web page while being viewed in a browser.

How do I write script for a web page?

Script: A series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

## State the Goal

- Define
- Design
- Code

## End Goal: 
Creating instructions that a computer can follow to make the website interactive.
